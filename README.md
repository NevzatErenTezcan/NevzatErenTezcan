## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

  I'm Nevzat,a CS major at **Bilkent University**. I'm currently in my freshman year.At the moment i'm just learning
the ropes with fundamentals of computer science such as algorithms and basic programming.

  I'm open to any kind of help or suggestions with coding,programming,software,hardware or anything really.

  You can ask me about my academic and campus life,hobbies,sports,cultural activities or whatever you want since
i'd like to get to know fellow programmers and interact with them.
